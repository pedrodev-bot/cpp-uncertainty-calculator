# C++ Uncertainty Calculator

## Overview
A C++ command-line tool to calculate the mean and uncertainty of a series of measurements. This tool was developed to solve complex calculations for university physics laboratory reports. While the project is in a functional but "as-is" state, it was instrumental in achieving high-precision results that would have been prone to human error if done manually.

## The Impact
**Efficiency:** This code reduced what was originally **days of manual calculations** for me and my colleagues into a **few hours of work**.
**Precision:** Designed to handle calculations with high numerical precision to meet strict academic requirements.
**Collaboration:** Used as a shared utility to help my lab group streamline data processing and focus on the physics analysis rather than arithmetic.

## Status
This repository is currently up-to-date with my local development version. I don't intend to provide further updates, but the code remains here as a reference for anyone tackling similar lab work.
